Welcome to Friday, your personal task management assistant! This chatbot helps you stay organized by keeping track of your tasks, deadlines and events.

## Adding deadlines

The deadline command allows you to add a task with a specific deadline to the task list. You must provide a task description and a date for deadline. This will create a task that is marked with a deadline.

Example: `deadline return book /by 2024-01-23`

This command will add a task with the description "return book" and a deadline of January 23, 2024.

```
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] return book (by: Sep 30 2024)
Now you have N tasks in the list.
```
